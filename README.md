# MinecraftWhitelistAdderBot
A Discord bot which is capable of adding usernames to the whitelist on the server throught Discord slash commands and RCON.\
I've created this for my own purposes, but I'm pretty sure there's a lot of RCON discord bots out there.\
If you need something very simple as that, you can freely use it.\
This bot was written using [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) and [rconsharp](https://github.com/stefanodriussi/rconsharp).
